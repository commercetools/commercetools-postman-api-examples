This is the github repository for the commercetools platform Postman collection, that is available here:  https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2267334/commercetools-platform-api/6fR3nEb

This Postman collection contains all endpoints and commands of the commercetools platform API. For every command the smallest possible payload is given. Please find optional fields in the related official documentation. Additionally the collection provides example requests and responses for specific tasks and more complex data models.

To use this collection in Postman please perform the following steps:

Download and install the Postman Client
Click the "Run in Postman"-button in the header of this page to clone this collection to your Postman client
Duplicate the environment "commercetools Plattform.template" and fill out your commercetools client credentials
Obtain an access token by sending the "Obtain access token" request at the bottom of the request list. Now you can use all other endpoints.
Feel free to clone and modify this collection to your needs.

To automate frequent tasks the collection automatically manages commonly required values and parameters such as access tokens or resource ids and versions in Postman environment variables for you.
